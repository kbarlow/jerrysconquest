# Jerry's Conquest

## Overview
Jerry's Conquest is a modern 2D action RPG (ARPG) built in Python using pygame. Explore an infinite, procedurally generated world, battle monsters, and master sword and disc combat in a visually rich, highly interactive environment.

---

## Features

- **Procedural Infinite Terrain:**
  - The world is generated on-the-fly as you explore, with seamless chunk loading and a variety of grass and water tile variants for a natural look.
- **Smooth Player Movement & Camera:**
  - Responsive controls and a camera system that keeps the player centered, ensuring all movement and collisions are visually and logically in sync.
- **Combat System:**
  - Use sword and disc attacks to defeat monsters. The disc can be thrown in any direction and returns to the player, defeating orbs and monsters in its path.
- **Enemy AI:**
  - Monsters spawn randomly and shoot orbs at the player. Orbs track the player and disappear on hit, reducing health.
- **Modern Health Bar:**
  - A stylish ARPG-style health bar is displayed at the bottom left. Each orb hit reduces health by 10%. Game over triggers at 0%.
- **Pixel-Perfect Collision:**
  - All collisions (player, orbs, disc, monsters) use carefully tuned hitboxes for fair, visually accurate gameplay.
- **Visual Polish:**
  - Animated player and monster sprites, blood overlays on enemy defeat, splash screen, and multiple tile variants for a lively world.
- **Debugging & Dev Tools:**
  - Toggleable debug logging, centralized position logic, and robust error handling for smooth development.
